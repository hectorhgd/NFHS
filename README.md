# NFHS
This repository contains the R markdown scripts used for the realization of the Master's thesis "Patterns of antibiotic use for acute
respiratory infections in under-three-years-old children in India: a cross-sectional study" for the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Infectious Diseases and One Health. 

We created different R markwdown scripts for different stage of the project, at the beginning each file there is a brief description of the objectives for each script.

1) Data cleaning: input of the original .DTA file and reduction of observations.
- NFHS4_clean.Rmd
- NFHS4_HH_cleaning.Rmd
- NFHS5_clean.Rmd
- NFHS5_HH_cleaning.Rmd

2) Recoding of the data: renaming and categorization of variables of interest.
- NFHS4_recoding.Rmd 
- NFHS5_recoding.Rmd

3) Analysis of the data:
- nfhs_ari_unweighted_table1.Rmd
- nfhs_ari_weighted_table1.Rmd
- nfhs_ari_weighted_table2.Rmd
- nfhs_ari_regional_analysis.Rmd
- nfhs_ari_regression.Rmd


This code has been developed by Hector Gonzalez Dorta under the supervision of Dr. Arijit Nandi, McGill University.

Unfortunately, the original datafiles are too big and they cannot be uploaded to this platform. In case of wanting to reproduce the results obtained in the Master's Thesis please contact hectorglezdorta@gmail.com to receive access to these files.
